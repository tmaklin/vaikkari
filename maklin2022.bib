	abstract = {Genomic epidemiology is a tool for tracing transmission of pathogens based on whole-genome sequencing. We introduce the {mGEMS} pipeline for genomic epidemiology with plate sweeps representing mixed samples of a target pathogen, opening the possibility to sequence all colonies on selective plates with a single {DNA} extraction and sequencing step. The pipeline includes the novel {mGEMS} read binner for probabilistic assignments of sequencing reads, and the scalable pseudoaligner Themisto. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using closely related samples in a nosocomial setting, obtaining results that are comparable to those based on single-colony picks. Our results lend firm support to more widespread consideration of genomic epidemiology with mixed infection samples.},

Here, we present the {mSWEEP} pipeline for identifying and estimating the relative sequence abundances of bacterial lineages from plate sweeps of enrichment cultures. {mSWEEP} leverages biologically grouped sequence assembly databases, applying probabilistic modelling, and provides controls for false positive results. Using sequencing data from major pathogens, we demonstrate significant improvements in lineage quantification and detection accuracy. Our pipeline facilitates investigating cultures comprising mixtures of bacteria, and opens up a new field of plate sweep metagenomics.},

	abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa ({sSA}), there is high morbidity and mortality from severe bacterial infection and this is compounded by antimicrobial resistance, in particular, resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins. This resistance is typically mediated by extended-spectrum beta lactamases ({ESBLs}). To interrupt {ESBL} transmission it will be important to investigate how human behaviour, water, sanitation, and hygiene ({WASH}) practices, environmental contamination, and antibiotic usage in both urban and rural settings interact to contribute to transmission of {ESBL} E. coli and {ESBL} K. pneumoniae between humans, animals, and the environment.
            Here we present the protocol for the Drivers of Resistance in Uganda and Malawi ({DRUM}) Consortium, in which we will collect demographic, geospatial, clinical, animal husbandry and {WASH} data from a total of 400 households in Uganda and Malawi. Longitudinal human, animal and environmental sampling at each household will be used to isolate {ESBL} E. coli and {ESBL} K. pneumoniae. This will be complimented by a Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities and Self-Regulation ({RANAS}) survey and structured observations to understand the contextual and psychosocial drivers of regional {WASH} practices.
            Bacterial isolates and plate sweeps will be further characterised using a mixture of short-,long-read and metagenomic whole-genome sequencing. These datasets will be integrated into agent-based models to describe the transmission of {EBSL} resistance in Uganda and Malawi and allow us to inform the design of interventions for interrupting transmission of {ESBL}-bacteria.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.02.20.480002},
	abstract = {Characterising the genetic diversity of pathogens within the host promises to greatly improve surveillance and reconstruction of transmission chains. For bacteria, it also informs our understanding of inter-strain competition, and how this shapes the distribution of resistant and sensitive bacteria. Here we study the genetic diversity of
            Streptococcus pneumoniae
            within individual infants and their mothers by deep sequencing whole pneumococcal populations from longitudinal nasopharyngeal samples. We demonstrate deep sequencing has unsurpassed sensitivity for detecting multiple colonisation, doubling the rate at which highly invasive serotype 1 bacteria were detected in carriage compared to gold-standard methods. The greater resolution identified an elevated rate of transmission from mothers to their children in the first year of the child’s life. Comprehensive treatment data demonstrated infants were at an elevated risk of both the acquisition, and persistent colonisation, of a multidrug resistant bacterium following antimicrobial treatment. Some alleles were enriched after antimicrobial treatment, suggesting they aided persistence, but generally purifying selection dominated within-host evolution. Rates of co-colonisation imply that in the absence of treatment, susceptible lineages outcompeted resistant lineages within the host. These results demonstrate the many benefits of deep sequencing for the genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens.},
